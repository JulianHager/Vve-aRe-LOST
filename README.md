# Vve-aRe-LOST

ùïçVE A‚ÑùE LOST is an asymmetric multiplayer game, where one or more VR Players face off against a PC player.
The game takes place inside of a randomly generated labyrinth at night time. The VR players spawn directly into the ruins, where they have to find the key-item that‚Äôs hidden inside one of the level‚Äôs many chests in order to escape the maze and win the game. They are equipped with only a single lit torch that illuminates the otherwise dark scene. Additional torches on the walls may be lit to provide more helpful vision.
The PC player joins as an antagonist in birds eye view with the goal to prevent the VR players from escaping by either manipulating the labyrinth‚Äôs layout to disturb the VR players‚Äô orientation or by spawning spider-enemies to hunt down and potentially kill the fleeing players. The PC player will have to make educated guesses regarding the VR players‚Äô positions, since they themselves are inherently invisible and only reveal their rough location via the light emitted by the torches.
